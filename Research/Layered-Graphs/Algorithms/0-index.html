 barycenter.alg
 An animation of barycenter algorithm for crossing minimization.

 Caution: assumes that the graph is paritioned into layers, defined by
 y-coordinates of the nodes and that all the edges are between nodes that
 lie on adjacent layers. Edges are directed from lower numbered layers to
 higher numbered ones. See LayeredGraph.java for more information

 An implementation of the mce algorithm for crossing minimization.

 Caution: assumes that the graph is paritioned into layers, defined by
 y-coordinates of the nodes and that all the edges are between nodes that
 lie on adjacent layers. Edges are directed from lower numbered layers to
 higher numbered ones. See LayeredGraph.java for more information

 mod_bary.alg
 An animation of the modified barycenter algorithm for crossing minimization.

 The algorithm finds the layer with the maximum number of crossings, sorts
 its nodes based on positions of both neighboring layers and completes a
 pass going in both directions from the max layer.

 @date 2014/3/16 An animation of the sifting algorithm for crossing
 minimization. Code is taken directly from the C implementation in my
 crossing minimization software.

 Caution: assumes that the graph is paritioned into layers, defined by
 y-coordinates of the nodes and that all the edges are between nodes that
 lie on adjacent layers. Edges are directed from lower numbered layers to
 higher numbered ones. See LayeredGraph.java for more information
