<h2>Galant Algorithm Examples</h2>


<h3>Unweighted Graph Algorithms</h3>

<ul>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=bfs.alg>bfs.alg</a></b> 
<br>
An Animation of breadth-first search. Undirected edges are regarded as
being directed both ways.
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=dfs.alg>dfs.alg</a></b> 
<br>
Animates depth-first search of a graph, directed or undirected; in the
undirected case, it behaves as if edges were directed in both directions.
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=dfs_d.alg>dfs_d.alg</a></b>
<br>
Animates depth-first search of a directed graph only; directedness is
forced at the beginning of the algorithm.
If the graph were undirected, tree edges would be relabeled as back edges and
back edges relabeled as forward edges
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=interactive_dfs.alg>interactive_dfs.alg</a></b> 
<br>
Animates depth-first search of a directed graph
only; directedness is forced at the beginning of the algorithm; allows
user to specify start node and next node to visit in each iteration of the
outer loop.
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=dfs_scc.alg>dfs_scc.alg</a></b> 
  <br>
  Same as interactive_dfs, but adds the reverse depth-first search that
  computes strongly connected components.
<br><br>
</ul>

<h3>Weighted Graph Algorithms</h3>

<ul>
<li><b><a href=dijkstra.alg>dijkstra.alg</a></b> 
An animation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Interprets
undirected edges as going in both directions.
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href="euclidian.alg">euclidian.alg</a></b> 
<br>
An animation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Interprets
undirected edges as going in both directions.
Unlike dijkstra.alg, the edge weights are set initially by the
algorithm, based on Euclidian distances between nodes.
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href="kruskal.alg">kruskal.alg</a></b> 
<br>
animation of Kruskal's MST algorithm; edges are sorted at the beginning and
the algorithm continues until all edges have been considered
<br>
<br><hr>
<br>
<b><a href="kruskal_pq.alg">kruskal_pq.alg</a></b><br>
An animation of Kruskal's MST algorithm; edges are put on a priority queue at
the beginning and the algorithm stops when a tree has been formed; assumes
that the graph is connected
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href="boruvka.alg">boruvka.alg</a></b> 
An animation of Boruvka's MST algorithm; designed
to showcase some of the newer Galant facilities.<br>
Among these are:<br>
- hideLabel() and showLabel() for graph elements to identify components<br>
- hide() and show() for graph elements to show only the edges that are relevant<br>
- color() and uncolor() for graph elements using predefined colors
<br>
<br><hr>
</ul>

<h3>Sorting Algorithms</h3>

All of these assume that the input graph has no edges and that the node
weights represent the keys of elements to be sorted.

<ul>
<li><b><a href=bubble_sort.alg>bubble_sort.alg</a></b> 
An animation of bubble sort.
This is the simplest version of bubble sort; makes a pass over the whole
list each iteration
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=insertion_sort.alg>insertion_sort.alg</a></b> 
An animation of insertion sort.
The already sorted part of the array is marked. The element to be
inserted moves along the array -- the element to which it is compared at
each step is highlighted.
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href=quicksort.alg>quicksort.alg</a></b> 

An animation of Quicksort<br>
<em>authors: Hayden Fuss, Solomon Yeh, Jordan Connor</em><br>
<em>CSC 316, Data Structures, Spring 2015, Project</em><br>
This Quicksort implementation chooses the median index of the list
as the pivot, and can handle an arbitrary sized array, but
visual fidelity for large arrays requires extra vertical space
<br>
<br>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous Algorithms</h3>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="binary_tree.alg">binary_tree.alg</a></b> 
<br>
Draws a binary tree that fits into current graph window. First queries the
user about the tree height.
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href="grid.alg">grid.alg</a></b> 
<br>
Creates a grid graph with dimensions supplied by user
<br>
<br><hr>
<li><b><a href="strip_attributes.alg">strip_attributes.alg</a></b> 
<br>
Strips out unneccessary attributes from graphs
where weights, labels and colors were created inadvertently
during editing.
<br>
</ul>
