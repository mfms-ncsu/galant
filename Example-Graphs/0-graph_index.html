<h2>Example Graphs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="0-SortingGraphs/0-sorting_graph_index.html">0-SortingGraphs</a>
    - directory containing "graphs" appropriate for sorting algorithms; these
    have nodes representing array/list elements with weights as keys and no
    edges 
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="ce_dijkstra.graphml">ce_dijkstra.graphml</a>
    - a graph with negative edge weights that serves as a
    counterexample to the proof of correctness of Dijsktra's algorithm.
  </li>
<li><a href="createMesh.py">createMesh.py</a>
  - a python script for creating a mesh in graphml format;
  run standalone (no need to invoke python)
  with no arguments to get a usage message.
  See also the <a href="../Algorithms/grid.alg">grid algorithm</a>, which
  creates a grid via an animation execution - it can be saved using the
  Export option: File menu on the graph window. 
</li>

  <li>
    <a href="random_tree.py">random_tree.py</a>
    - a python script with lots of options for creating random trees
    (optional weights on nodes and edges, node positions, etc.); run
    with <code>-h</code> option to get full details.
  </li>
  
  <li><a href="tree.graphml">tree.graphml</a> - a simple tree (unweighted)
    </li>
  <li><a href="unweighted_7.graphml">unweighted_7.graphml</a>
- a seven-node, unweighted graph, suitable as
  a directed graph
  for
  the <a href="../Algorithms/dfs.alg">dfs</a> (undirected depth-first
  search), 
  <a href="../Algorithms/dfs_d.alg">dfs_d</a> (directed depth-first search),
  and <a href="../Algorithms/interactive_dfs.alg">interactive_dfs</a> (depth
  first search with start nodes controlled by user) algorithms
  </li>

<li><a href="unweighted_8.graphml">unweighted_8.graphml</a>
- an eight-node, unweighted graph, suitable for the dfs variations
  </li>

<li><a href="unweighted_9.graphml">unweighted_9.graphml</a>
- an nine-node, unweighted graph, suitable for the dfs variations
  </li>

<li><a href="weighted_10.graphml">weighted_10.graphml</a> - a weighted graph
with ten nodes, useful for demonstrating minimum spanning tree algorithms or
shortest paths algorithms; boruvka does two passes on this one</li>

<li><a href="weighted_6.graphml">weighted_6.graphml</a>
- a weighted graph with six nodes, used for demonstrating how
<a href="../Algorithms/dijkstra.alg">Dijkstra's algorithm</a>
behaves differently for undirected versus directed graphs; boruvka also does
two passes on this one</li>

<li><a href="weighted_7.graphml">weighted_7.graphml</a>
  - based on an example for single-source shortest paths in Cormen et al.,
  "Introduction to Algorithms"; one extra node was added.
</li>

  <li>
    <a href="triangulation_64.graphml">triangulation_64.graphml</a>
    - geometric triangulation with 64 vertices; there are no edge weights but
    the important algorithms calculate these; 
  </li>
  <a href="triangulation_64-shrunk.graphml">triangulation_64-shrunk.graphml</a>
  - a version of the previous graph that will fit onto a "normal" screen
  <li>
  </li>
  <li>
  <a href="geo_40_67_1.graphml">geo_40_67_1.graphml</a>
  - a geometric graph (nodes are positioned as random points on the plane and
  connected if within a given radius); an example that confounds
  force-directed layout
  </li>

<li>
  <a href="r_25_40_1.graphml">r_25_40_1.graphml</a>
  - a random graph with no positional information; useful for testing
  force-directed layout
  </li>

  <li>
  <a href="layered_graph.graphml">layered_graph.graphml</a> - a small layered
  graph; can be used to test how layered graph drawings adapt to window size.  
  </li>
</ul>
