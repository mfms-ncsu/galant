# Bugs and annoyances, ncsu_final branch

* labels sometimes get obscured on the right
* similarly, sometimes there's not enough room at the bottom
* positions have really large numbers when a new graph is drawn
* the t-graph flipped upside down when I saved it (after drawing from scratch)

# Ideas

* make expansion and contraction with window dimensions optional; for example, Ctrl-b could trigger a fit window command (b for bounding box)
