The following must be done for each new release.
  - change the VERSION string in Galant.java
  - change the \VERSION command in Technical-Documentation/galant.sty
  - add release notes to the beginning of release-notes.txt; should do this in an ongoing fashion and add to the release comment when the new release is published.
  - make sure the current commit has been pushed
  - be sure to sign in!
