Heuristics for crossing minimization in layered graphs. The only actively
maintained ones are:

- barycenter.alg, see, e.g., DiBattista et al. (1991 text)

- mce.alg, as described by Stallmann (JEA, 2012)

- sifting.alg, as described by Matuszewski et al. (Graph Drawing 1999)

All are based directly on software supplied with the 2012 JEA paper.
