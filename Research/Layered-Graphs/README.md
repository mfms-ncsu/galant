Three directories.

* Algorithms contains animations of several heuristics for crossing minimization.
* Original-Graphs has benchmark and synthetic graphs in their original form, thus suitable for running the heuristics
* Processed-Graphs has graphs that have been optimized with respect to one or more objectives, as indicated by the suffix after the dash; b, t, s, and v stand for bottleneck/total crossings, stretch, and verticality, respectively
